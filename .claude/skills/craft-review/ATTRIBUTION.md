# Attribution

This skill was assembled by synthesizing *ideas* from the sources below and
writing the entries in original words. Ideas and methods are not copyrightable;
expression is.

Verified 2026-08-16 by an 8-word-run overlap scan (`tools/overlap.py` in the
source repo) of every file in this skill against every source listed here.
Results are recorded per source.

Contributed the category-reflex test, the idea of deterministic slop
detectors, and the four-part color-strategy taxonomy — one restrained accent,
a committed saturation, a full semantic palette, or color as the ground — which
`references/design-tropes.md` names as theirs at the entry that uses it.

*Statement of changes (required by Apache-2.0 §4b):* no file from impeccable is
reproduced here. Its detection concepts were reimplemented from scratch against
this skill's own three-score model and trope catalog. The color-strategy
taxonomy is used as a taxonomy — its four categories, not its wording — and the
entry using it credits impeccable by name.

Corrected 2026-08-22. This paragraph previously described the overlap scan's one
8-word hit as an incidental fragment of color terminology. It was not incidental:
the four category names were impeccable's and the sentence carrying them repeated
their gloss almost exactly. Legal under Apache-2.0 with the attribution above,
and against this repo's own practice of taking the idea and writing the
expression fresh, so the entry was rewritten. Found by two independent harvest
passes on the same night, which is the argument for running the scan rather than
trusting the last person's reading of it.

`AccessLint/skills` contributed the idea of tagging findings by evidence basis and marking
criteria a tool cannot test as human-required rather than passed — which is why the
accessibility score now reports its coverage. `vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines`
contributed the typographic micro-detail checks. `bencium/bencium-marketplace` contributed
the sharper reading of icon consistency (style and weight, not only family and size).
No text was taken from any of them; a 2026-08-17 scan found no shared phrasing.

`hallmark` contributed the slop-test gates and the two-briefs framing.
`refactoring-ui-skill` and `jezweb/claude-skills` informed the craft layer.
The overlap scan found no shared phrasing with `hallmark` or
`refactoring-ui-skill`. The only match against `jezweb/claude-skills` was a
string of WCAG 2.2 contrast thresholds (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large and UI
components) — facts, which carry no copyright.

Neither repository publishes a license, so neither grants redistribution
rights. Nothing from either is redistributed here: the overlap scan found
**zero** shared 8-word runs with either, against every file in this skill.
Their contribution was conceptual only.

## Ideas only — no license published

**nolanperk/rad-spacing** — https://github.com/nolanperk/rad-spacing

No license, so no redistribution rights. Nothing is redistributed here. It contributed one
idea: spacing should encode nesting depth, each level roughly 1.4x its child, grounded in
Gestalt proximity. That idea is expressed here in original words and the scan confirms zero
shared phrasing.

## Standards cited, not reproduced

Target-size and contrast figures come from **WCAG 2.2** (W3C), Apple's **Human Interface
Guidelines**, and **Material Design 3**. Measurements are facts and carry no copyright; the
guidelines' prose does, and none is reproduced. Apple's HIG is copyright Apple Inc. and
Material's documentation is Google's.

**Not used:** Anthropic's `frontend-design` skill was examined and deliberately not
harvested. It is copyright Anthropic PBC, all rights reserved, under Commercial Terms of
Service — not open source.

## Predecessor

This skill extends an earlier `design-review` skill, which was developed
locally and installed from a local directory rather than from any marketplace
or public repository. The sources listed above under "Ideas only" and MIT are
that skill's documented lineage; all of them have been scanned.

external standards; no text from them is reproduced.
